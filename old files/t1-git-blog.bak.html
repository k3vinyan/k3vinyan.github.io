<h1>My First Blog Post</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Makeven Yan and this is my very first blog post.  Today I was asked to cover some concepts I learned during my phase 0 lessons at Dev Bootcamp.</p>

<p>Below are the questions given:</p>

<ul>
    <li>What are the benefits of version control?
    <li>How does git help you keep track of changes?
    <li>Why use GitHub to store your code?
</ul>

<H4>Version Control and Its Benefits</h4>

<p>Version control is a system that many individuals and companies used as part of their quality assurance.  Version control records changes made in a file(s) and allows the individuals to recall that specific "save point.""  You can compare this to saving multiples files in a game and recalling onto the one you like to return to.  Besides enabling the developer to have multiple back-up of the files, version control have other benefits as well.  In most cases, version control allows others to collaborate on a project without the fear of accidently overriding someone else contribution.  This allows work to flow at a effective and timely matter. </p>

<h4> Tracking changes in Git </h4>

<p>GGit is one of the most popular form of version control.  It is a distributed revision control system developed by Linus Torvaids.  What may separated Git from other version control system is Git work directly with the directory and repository of the system that allows for a full tracking capabilities. Git is usually used on a locally platform with the users track changes remotely.  In most cases, Git is used congruently with a remote version control system. </p>

<h4> Why used GitHub </h4>

<p>Github is one of the popular version control system hosting site.  One of the reason GitHub is used among others is it allows code to be shared and collaborated on.  The ideas that code can allows be improved upon has created a social median for all coders alike.  It also somewhat became a showcase for employers to view the individual's ability to code.   GitHub has became to go to for sharing and collaboration for coders. </p>

I hope this was helpful for beginners in coding!
