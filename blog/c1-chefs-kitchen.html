      Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

        After watching the video, I learned that Dev Bootcamp is all about helping each other out.  This is very important if you want to survive and fit in with the culture at Dev Bootcamp.    As I continue to work on the lessons and listening to the staff of DB, you get the idea that they want you be open and be straight forward of your ignorance with them and other students.   I agree with the DB policy.   If you stay closed minded and keep to yourself, you only hurt yourself in your development.    My expectation of DBC still remains the same.  I knew that the Dev Bootcamp want to create an environment that involve learning from each other.    I am excited and nervous to be part of DBC.
