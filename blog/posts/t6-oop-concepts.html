			<date class="date">Posted on May 17, 2014</date>

			<p>Scope is the formal term that represents when you can access a variable or method and when you can't. It's nothing explicit in the code (you're never calling a method named scope or anything like that); it's just a concept. If your variable is "in scope" then it's available for use, otherwise it's "out of scope".</p>

			<p>Scope refers to the reach or visibility of variables. Different types of variables have different scoping rules. We'll be talking chiefly about two types: global and local variables.</p>

			<h3>Global scope and global variables</h3>

			<p>We're starting with the scope that's used least often, but which you need to be aware of: global scope, meaning scope that covers the entire program. Global scope is enjoyed by global variables. Global variables are distinguished by starting with a dollar-sign ($) character. They are available everywhere in your program. Global variables never go out of scope. However, global variables are used very little by experienced programmers (except perhaps a few of the built-in ones).</p>

			<h3>Built-in global variables</h3>

			<p>The Ruby interpreter starts up with a fairly large number of global variables already initialized. These variables store information that's of potential use anywhere and everywhere in your program. For example, the global variable $0 contains the name of the file Ruby is executing. The global $: (dollar sign followed by a colon) contains the directories that make up the path Ruby searches when you load an external file. $$ contains the process id of the Ruby process. And there are more.</p>

			<h3>Local scope</h3>

			<p>The top level (outside of all definition blocks) has its own local scope.
			Every class or module definition block (class, module) has its own local scope, even nested class/module definition blocks.
			Every method definition (def) has its own local scope.</p>
