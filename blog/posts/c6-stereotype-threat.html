		<div class="content"><h3>Stereotype</h3>
			<date class="date">Posted on May 17, 2014</date>

			<h4>In your post, consider whether you can identify times when you have been impacted by it.If you have, how did it affect your achievement?</h4> 

			<p>Yes, as a minority in this country, there are certain stereotype that we face in the workforce.  I learn to cope with it and not let it bother me.  I believe is just something that this generation will have to deal with until the years past and everyone more liberal about the situation.</p>

			<h4>What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically?</h4> 
			<p>I didn't ask myself any questions and didn't have any physically attachment with it.</p>

			<h4>If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine how it would feel to?</h4> 
			<p>I believe that someone can somewhat feel or put them in someone shoes but they will never truly understand the harness until they have to deal it themselves.  Like how someone who rich will never know the feeling of struggling for a meal until they experience it themselves.</p>

			<h4>If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation?</h4>
			<p>People would always think that they would but I think most people won't.  In a working environment, a lot of pressure is already place upon the person and adding additional stress to the workload would only turn them away even further.</p> 

			<h4>Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat?</h4>
			<p> I think the basic kindness is always the key.  It doesn't matter the situation, being kind and understanding of someone situation is what is means to be a humble person.</p>
