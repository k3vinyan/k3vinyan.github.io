			<h3>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</h3>

			 <p>I think when I the most happiest is when your a kid.  When your a kid,  your mind is at ease and you don't have a care in the world.  You also do know the realitiy of the world and how violent or how horrible the world is sometimes.  Because of this, having a younger mind set is key for me to be happy.  Your mind as to be at peace, you shouldn't what other think of you and pursue your own hapiness.  like the motto "You do you and I do me. "  If I had to pick top three values for myself it would be true to yourself,  be mindful of others, and do what you love. </p>


			 <!--<h3>Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1: In general, I try to live up to these values:</h3> -->
			 <h3>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you.</h3>

			 <p>Out of all the values on the list, peace feels most important to me.  Having peace with yourself leads to a must happier life.  I grew up in famiy that follow buddhism.  Even though i don't really consider myself a buddhish,  I still follow many of this aspect and believe that many of its teaching.  One of the things I learn lviing in a buddhish family is life is feel with pain and suffering which sounds pretty morbid.  When grewing up you learn to be at peace with this.  That sometimes things are going to be bad and sometimes that you don't always get what you want.  But if you learn to be at positive and at peace with  yourself, you become more happier and ease.

			 <h3>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?
			Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</h3>

			<p>Of course.  Being at peace and knowing some people are just asshole can really keep you positive.  Out of mind out of sight.  I recently try to pick up meditiation which I think is helping me deal with stress.</p>
