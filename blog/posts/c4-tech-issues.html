		<div class="content"><h3>The tech Generation</h3>
			<date class="date">Posted on May 09, 2015</date>
			<p>Students are so quick to turn to the Internet to answer questions that some believe critical thinking has gone down the tube.  Spelling is no longer something tested if everything is autocorrected and spell checked.  This may be a larger issue of technology on our memory and brain-strength, but if we are using the Internet in schools, then kids are being taught to use Google to answer all their questions and to essentially, copy and paste their knowledge.  Education needs to figure out how to use technology in a way that doesn’t replace knowledge, but reinforces it.</p>

			<p>And Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, etcetera.  Putting a computer in front of a high school student and expecting them NOT to go on Facebook or any other distracting non-school related site is kind of a joke.  And it isn’t just the younger students that are in danger of losing focus; even graduate students can hardly help themselves to online distractions in the classroom.  When keeping students excited and focused on the lesson at hand is one of the hardest task a teacher faces, a computer can be one of the most detrimental things to that student’s learning.</p>
