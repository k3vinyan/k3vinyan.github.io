			<p>Pairing:</p>

    		<p>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</p>

    			<p>At first, it was pretty intimidating because I was unsure in my own ability in coding and didn’t want to come off like I didn’t know anything.  But pretty quickly I learn that we’re all in the same boat.  We both are trying to develop a new skills set and even though sometime we at a whole different level when I comes to actual knowledge; I found that the more knowledgeable person is always willing to teach the other person.  Everyone here to learn and develop through the program and through each other.</p> 

    		<p>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</p>

    			<p>Honestly, everything we are learning is fun/rewarding but stressful sometimes.  I great when we get a solutions right out of the gate but when we don't....well, it can be very frustrating.But if I had to choose, I would choose the HTML/CSS challenge since we get to create and development our own website to our likling.

    		<p>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</p>

    			<p>EVERYTHING!!!


			<p>Feedback</p>

    		<p>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</p>

    			<p>I feel pretty comfortable with reading the feedback.  Nothing has come back so far with any real negative criticism.  Lets keep our finger cross.</p>


    		<p>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</p>

    			<p>They are very helpful as they point out want I need to improve on and how I should perform during the next paring session.</p>

    		<p>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</p>

    			<p>Definitely!  I find myself talking out loud more and speaking my mind instead of usually taking the backseat in the situation.</p>

    		<p>How was it to write feedback?</p>

    			<p> It pretty easy.  To be honest, it getting really repititive since I haven't really ran into someone who I thought was not holding their weight in the session when we pair up.  I probably need to learn to be more critical of others so I can tell them how they can improve.  I guess I need to work on that more.</p>


    		<p>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</p>

    			<p>The most difficult part of writing feedback is actually giving them some critical feedbacks.  I find this hard because in most session your sort of focusing on yourself and how you interact with your pair and how you can help on finding the solution.   I don't really look to find any mistake or how they can improve.</p>

			<p>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</p>
				
				<p>I think how things are now is pretty helpful in my development.
